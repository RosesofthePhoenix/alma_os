# Canonical Document: X/Q/HCE Consciousness State Layer in ALMA OS

Filename: alma_os_state_layer_canonical.md  
Version: 1.0 (January 3, 2026)  
Author: Ray Jesus Antonio Craig Antelo  
Purpose: Definitive reference for ALMA OS state metrics. Explains computation and combinatorial criteria to ground the Oracle’s guidance. Designed to sit alongside FAE (Fractal Architecture of Existence) and Legacy writings as a system prompt prefix.

## 1. Metric Definitions and Computation

**X — Activation / Dynamics Scaffold**  
- Measures broadband neural activation and engagement regimes.  
- Higher X → faster dynamics, aroused/focused states.  
- Typical range: ~1.0–2.2 (baseline ~1.6).  
- Role: Grounds embodied effort; stable X supports sustained work.

**Q_vibe_focus — Canonical Qualia Proxy**  
- Composite of meaningful richness (structured deviation from baseline) weighted by focus/engagement.  
- Higher Q → immersive, awe-like resonance beyond noise.  
- Typical range: ~0.01–0.4 (peaks are rare).  
- Role: Captures “what it feels like” — aesthetic/emotional depth.

**HCE — Harmonious Consciousness Elevation (Scaled, Super-Linear)**  
- Formula: \((Q_{\text{vibe\_focus}} / X)^{1.5} \times Q_{\text{vibe\_focus}} \times 10000\).  
- Detects disproportionate harmony (qualitative lift beyond activation).  
- Typical range: ~0–100+ scaled (peaks >20 indicate profound transcendence).  
- Role: Differentiates true harmony from strain or richness alone.

**Masking & Validity**  
- All metrics are masked by reliability/validity gating. Raw diagnostics remain accessible.

## 2. Combinatorial Criteria for States of Mind

Interpretation is hierarchical: primary X/Q patterning, with HCE overlay for transcendence.

- **Deep Work / Flow**  
  - Criteria: mean_X > 1.7, std_Q < 0.10, sustained Q > 0.12.  
  - Interpretation: High activation with steady richness; maintain focus.

- **Ideation / Creative Exploration**  
  - Criteria: std_Q > 0.15 with positive Q_slope.  
  - Interpretation: Volatile, rising richness; explore and capture ideas.

- **Stress / Strain**  
  - Criteria: mean_X > 1.7, std_Q > 0.12, low HCE (<10 scaled) or low relative harmony (HCE/Q < 50).  
  - Interpretation: Activation dominant, harmony suppressed; recommend soothing / recovery.

- **Relaxed / Contemplative**  
  - Criteria: std_Q < 0.10, mean_X in 1.6–1.8, mean_HCE stable < 50 with low spikes, |Q_slope| ≤ 0.01.  
  - Interpretation: Contemplative calm; extend gently (soothing resonance).

- **Transcendent Harmony / Synthesis**  
  - Criteria: mean_HCE > 15 with stable X/Q.  
  - Interpretation: Unbounded elevation; prioritize insight, reflection, synthesis.

- **Recovery**  
  - Criteria: Validity drops or post-stress decrements.  
  - Interpretation: Movement/breath breaks; reset before re-engaging.

## 3. Philosophical Integration (FAE / Legacy)

- **X** grounds baseline cognition and embodied presence (foundation layer of FAE/FSE).  
- **Q_vibe_focus** shapes experiential richness and exponential alignment/growth.  
- **HCE** signals universal/recursive integration — the “fractal” synthesis moments.  
- The state layer operationalizes *Clocks–Cycles Rhythm*: timing tasks to the bodymind’s cadence, converting transient transcendence into lasting legacy.  
- Oracle should mirror these principles when guiding, weaving metric clarity with FAE/Legacy narrative depth.
