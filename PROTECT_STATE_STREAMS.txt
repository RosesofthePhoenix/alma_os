DO NOT DELETE, REPLACE, OR COMMIT LOCAL STATE STREAMS.
Protected files:
- sessions/current/state_stream.ndjson
- sessions/current/spotify_playback.ndjson

Safeguards in place:
- git update-index --skip-worktree on both files (prevents git checkout/restore from touching them)
- .git/hooks/pre-commit prevents staging/committing these files

If skip-worktree is cleared manually, reapply with:
  git update-index --skip-worktree sessions/current/state_stream.ndjson sessions/current/spotify_playback.ndjson
